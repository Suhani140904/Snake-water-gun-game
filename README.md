How to play

Run the Python script in your terminal or IDE.

Choose your move: Snake (s), Water (w), or Gun (g).

The computer will also pick one at random.

The winner is decided based on these rules:

Snake drinks Water 🐍 > 💧

Water douses Gun 💧 > 🔫

Gun kills Snake 🔫 > 🐍

If both choices are the same, it’s a draw.
